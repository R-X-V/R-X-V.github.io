# ðŸ§  About RXV Research

I created **RXV Research** as a personal archive of my thoughts, tools, techniques, and ideas in the world of software reverse engineering, anti-cheat analysis, and digital protection bypassing.

## ðŸŽ¯ Climbing the Arasaka tower

My goal is to reach a high level of technical expertise. Iâ€™m driven by the complexity of the challenge itself and the pursuit of mastery.

## ðŸ“š What You'll Find Here

This blog is a **living archive of documented research**,  It includes:

- Reverse engineering notes and logs
- Anti-cheat bypass methodologies
- Malware analysis
- DRM analysis  
- Packer analysis
- Obfuscation analysis
- Kernel-level code and experiments
- User-mode code that I may use
- Project breakdowns
- Conceptual ideas and proofs-of-concept  

Every post is a piece of my journey â€” shared not just for myself, but for the underground minds out there thinking the same way.  


## ðŸ§© Notes

Some posts may contain **mistakes, misassumptions, or outdated info**. If you catch something off â€” whether itâ€™s technical, factual, or stylistic â€” Iâ€™d seriously appreciate a heads-up.
